            <span>I am a huge fan of Tarantino movies, Nintendo games, anime and I am also a self-taught music producer (although amateur!)</span>
            <span>I have been editing photos, filming and editing videos since elementary school and combining my knowledge of film, videogames and music is a goal I set for myself every time I design a website.</span></p>
