        bio: "Hey, my name is Austin Caron. I'm a 21 year old nerd who's ready to code your projects. I wouldn't say that I'm a designer, but I don't lack in layout, UX and UI. Along with being a nerd, my hobbies / interests include: Harry Potter, World of Warcraft, and learning JavaScript and PHP. I'm the guy that you don't often see the name of, but gets everything working smoothly (mostly).",

        bio: "My name is Patrick Bradley, Iâ€™m  20 years old and living in London Ontario. I am mainly focused on motion design and video production, but I am increasingly becoming interested in front end coding. I am a huge fan of Tarantino movies, Nintendo games, anime and I am also a self-taught music producer (although amateur!) I have been editing photos, filming and editing videos since elementary school and combining my knowledge of film, videogames and music is a goal I set for myself every time I design a website.",
