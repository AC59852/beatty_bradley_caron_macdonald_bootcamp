        bio: "Hey, my name is Austin Caron. I'm a 21 year old nerd who's ready to code your projects. I wouldn't say that I'm a designer, but I don't lack in layout, UX and UI. Along with being a nerd, my hobbies / interests include: Harry Potter, World of Warcraft, and learning JavaScript and PHP. I'm the guy that you don't often see the name of, but gets everything working smoothly (mostly).",
